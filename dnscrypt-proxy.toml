# dnscrypt-proxy configuration — DoH-only upstream resolver
#
# This service acts as a local DNS resolver inside the Docker network.
# It forwards all queries to upstream DoH servers (port 443) and exposes
# plain DNS (port 53) to the doh-server container.
#
# All external traffic is encrypted (DoH over HTTPS/443).
